**Link to project:** [Picture of the Day](https://nicoledicochea.github.io/nasa-picture-of-the-day/)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, API

Find the picture of the day taken from the NASA database itself using their [public API](https://api.nasa.gov/).<br><br>
But, don't just stop at today. Go back to yesterday. Matter of fact, try out your birthday!<br><br>
This app allows you to search through all past NASA POTDs.

## Lessons Learned:

Had to handle different data types. So, accounted for both images *and* videos by using a conditional in the fetch function.
